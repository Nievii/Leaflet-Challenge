# Leaflet-Challenge# Project: Earthquake Visualization using Leaflet

## Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) aims to enhance public and government awareness of global environmental issues through effective data visualization tools. As part of this initiative, you're tasked with creating visualizations for earthquake data sourced from the USGS.

## Before You Begin
1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new repository named `leaflet-challenge`.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Organize project files into `Leaflet-Part-1` and `Leaflet-Part-2` directories.
   - Ensure inclusion of HTML and JavaScript files for analysis.

2. **Dataset and Visualization**
   - Acquire earthquake datasets from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
   - Utilize Leaflet to plot earthquake data based on latitude and longitude.
   - Customize data markers to represent earthquake magnitude (size) and depth (color).
   - Include interactive popups providing additional earthquake information.
   - Develop a legend to contextualize earthquake data on the map.

## Instructions
### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
- Obtain earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
- Visualize earthquake data using Leaflet, integrating size and color markers based on magnitude and depth.
- Ensure popups display detailed earthquake information upon marker click.
- Design a legend to contextualize earthquake data on the map.

### Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)
- Optional task to plot tectonic plate data alongside earthquake data.
- Utilize additional base maps for enhanced visualization.
- Implement separate overlays for each dataset with independent toggling capabilities.
- Incorporate layer controls for the map.

## Requirements (Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization)
### Map (60 points)
- Ensure TileLayer loads error-free (20 points).
- Successfully connect to the GeoJSON API using D3 (20 points).
- Implement markers with sizes corresponding to earthquake magnitude (10 points).
- Create a legend showcasing depth and their respective colors (10 points).

### Data Points (40 points)
- Ensure data points scale with magnitude level (10 points).
- Implement color changes for data points based on depth level (10 points).
- Include tooltips for each point displaying Magnitude, location, and depth (10 points).
- Verify accurate loading of all data points in their correct locations (10 points).
